# Christopher Carroll Smith

PhD historian turned AI automation engineer, technical writer, and business consultant.

## My pitch

Now is not the time for businesses to be cutting headcount. Now is the time to have all hands on deck figuring out how to build and deploy AI tools to stay ahead of the coming tidal wave of business model disruption. Companies also need to shift how they hire technology talent. The most productive programmers won't be those with a mastery of "leetcode." They'll be those who can call upon high-level knowledge of design principles, software architecture, and existing codebases for managing automation pipelines. [Book a 15-minute consultation with me](https://christophercarrollsmith.com/#book) to chat about how early AI adoption can help insulate your business from disruption or even help you find an edge.
